# RZ50 (R-Zet) Engine

**NOTE:** The engine is still in development which means that many (or most) things could be changed

RZ engine is a server-oriented game engine. That means that it's headless natively. 
It has the main core component which is responsible for various common things and support for connecting plugins and subsystem modules which can extend or replace 
the base functionality of the engine. Developers can load the core module and specify the name of the config file which would be used by the engine. 
In that config file they can tune many of the engine settings and select which of the subsystems will be loaded at the engine start

The engine is being developed from absolute scratch (but some dependencies are used). It's aimed to use many features of the latest C++ standards
